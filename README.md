# BioMassWebsite

BioMassWebsite is a work in progress, test project I use to test and learn various front/back end technologies from HTML to PHP.

I started developing this project as an artificial "Official" video game website with some mandatory specifications such as:
  - Database linked to ingame event
  - Login system
  - Dynamic structure
  
This project is currently hosted on local server using WAMP and make use of a phpMyAdmin database + an unity developed application (an ingame simulation allowing user to register a new account + select a boss fight and skills for each heroe)  to reach it current full potential.

Next steps :
  - Dive deeper into database security
  - Dive deeper into PhP, ajax, SQL request
  - Normalize code from javascript to jquery
  - Media queries and responsive design
