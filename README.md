# BioMassWebsite

BioMassWebsite is a work in progress, test project I use to test and learn various front/back end technologies from HTML to PHP.

I started developing this project as an artificial "Official" video game website with some mandatory specifications such as:
  - Database linked to ingame event
  - Login system
  - Dynamic structure
  
This project is currently hosted on local server using WAMP and make use of a phpMyAdmin database + an unity developed application to reach it current full potential.
